					<p> Hello, my name is Antonio and I am currently in my last year at the university where I study Statistics. 
					    After some serious personal reflection on my passions and interests, I made a commitment to learn as 
					    much as I could about machine learning, data science, and the tech industry. </p>
					<p> Ever since I was young, I have always loved solving puzzles. This is how I see big data sets: for me it's 
					    a big puzzle that I want to solve. Finding patterns that no one else sees is the challenge for me. </p>
